Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


**Technology Stack**
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

**Team Roles**
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.



**Database Design**
1. User -
     Fields: id (Unique identifier), name (Full name of the user),email (User's email address),role (e.g., guest or host), createdAt (Account creation date)
     Relationships:
A user can own multiple properties (if host).
A user can make multiple bookings (if guest).
A user can write multiple reviews.
A user can make multiple payments.

3. Property
  Represents a listing created by a host.
    Fields: id (Unique identifier), title (Name of the property), description (Details about the property),location (Address or coordinates), pricePerNight (Cost per night)
   Relationships: 
A property belongs to a user (the host).
A property can have multiple bookings.
A property can have multiple reviews.

5. Booking
    Represents a reservation by a guest.
    Fields:id (Unique identifier),userId (The guest who made the booking),propertyId (The property being booked),startDate (Check-in date),endDate (Check-out date)
    Relationships:

A booking belongs to a user (guest).
A booking belongs to a property.
A booking can have one payment.


4. Review
    Represents feedback left by a guest after a stay.
    Fields: id (Unique identifier),userId (Who wrote the review),propertyId (Which property was reviewed),rating (e.g., 1–5 stars),comment (Optional text feedback)
    Relationships:
A review belongs to a user.
A review belongs to a property.

5.  Payment
    Represents payment for a booking.
    Fields:id (Unique identifier),bookingId (Related booking),amount (Total cost),paymentDate (When the payment was made),status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)

    Relationships:
A payment belongs to a booking.
A payment indirectly belongs to a user (via booking).


**Feature Breakdown**
API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
**API Security**

1. Authentication
What it is: Verifying the identity of users (e.g., login with email/password, or social login).

Implementation:

Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

Support JWT or session-based authentication.

Add Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.

Why it’s crucial:
Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts, protecting personal info, bookings, and financial data.

2. Authorization
What it is: Controlling what authenticated users are allowed to do.

Implementation:

Role-based access control (e.g., guest vs. host vs. admin).

Route or resource-level permission checks.

Why it’s crucial:
Prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they don’t own (e.g., a guest editing another host’s listing).
 3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
What it is: Restricting how often users can make requests in a given time.

Implementation:

Use middleware to block excessive requests (e.g., express-rate-limit).

Apply especially to login, sign-up, and payment routes.

Why it’s crucial:
Mitigates brute-force attacks and protects system performance from abuse or DDoS attempts.
 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
What it is: Ensuring data submitted by users is clean and safe.

Implementation:

Validate all inputs on both frontend and backend.

Use libraries like Joi or express-validator.

Escape or sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

Why it’s crucial:
Prevents SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other code injection vulnerabilities.

5. Secure Payments
What it is: Ensuring that financial transactions are safe and tamper-proof.

Implementation:

Use a trusted third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

Enforce HTTPS during payment processing.

Tokenize and never store credit card details directly.

Why it’s crucial:
Protects users’ financial data and reduces liability for the platform.

 6. HTTPS & Secure Headers
What it is: Ensuring secure communication between client and server.

Implementation:

Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates.

Add security headers (e.g., Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy).

Why it’s crucial:
Prevents data leakage during transmission and protects against various client-side attacks.

 7. Logging & Monitoring
What it is: Keeping track of system activity and potential threats.

Implementation:

Log login attempts, failed requests, suspicious actions.

Use tools like Winston, ELK stack, or third-party monitoring services.

Why it’s crucial:
Helps detect and respond to breaches, abuse, or unexpected behavior early.

 8. Data Encryption (At Rest & In Transit)
What it is: Encrypting sensitive data both when stored and when sent over networks.

Implementation:

Encrypt passwords, tokens, and sensitive user data using AES or similar.

Use HTTPS (TLS) for all client-server communication.

Why it’s crucial:
Protects personal and financial information from being read if compromised.
**CI/CD Pipeline**

CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.
They are automated processes that help developers build, test, and deploy code faster and more reliably.

For an Airbnb-like project:
          Ensuring booking logic doesn’t break with a new update.
          Automatically deploying new features (like property listings or payment handling) safely.
          Keeping frontend and backend in sync during releases.
